### Autobiography 

Hello, My name is Oleksandr, I'm 25 years old. I was born in Crimea and raised in Donetsk, now hope to move to free part of Ukraine. Even though I have a formal education in computer science, I don't have any experience in real-life projects. I have worked on improving advertisements in Intsagram and on improving Bing search as web search evaluator, but due to recent sanctions I got fired, so i decided to join RS School to learn new skills that definitely have value worldwide â€“ Web Development. I tried to learn programming in the past, but never had enough patience to complete my education, but i believe that this time will be different. In my spare time i enjoy taking pictures, ediiting them and i love going to gym.

### My skills

1. HTML & CSS (Basics);
2. JavaScript (Fundamentals);
3. Git and Github;
4. SQL (relations databases);
5. Figma, Photoshop and Pixelmator.

### My code example

This is a solution to a task from CodeWars. Just a function, nothing serious, because as I mentioned earlier, I don't have any real-life experience or pet projects.

*Welcome. In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number and concatenate them. For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1.*

`function squareDigits(num)
{
  return Number(('' + num).split('').map(function (val) { return val * val;}).join(''));
}
`
